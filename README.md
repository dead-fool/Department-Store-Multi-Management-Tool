# Department-Store-Multi-Management-Tool

This tool allows the user to either sign in as a Manager or as a Cashier.
Firstly, the admin needs to create user ID for manager and cashier through admin menu by verifying the master key. The master key is defined in the source
code of the program.
The manager can log in using his created ID and password and carry out the tasks: adding goods to inventory, editing goods, deleting goods, displaying total sales and displaying goods inventory.
Similarly, the cashier can log in and carry out his/her billing duty. They can add items to the bill as much as they can from the existing inventory before printing the bill.
